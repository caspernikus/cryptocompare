#### What is the project about?
CryptoCompare is a NodeJS Bot which gathers the latest information about the top 10 crypto currencies, generates an html from it, screenshots it and then upload it to Spee.ch (LBRY Blockchain). Then it returns the image URL inside your console.

In detail is CryptoCompare used as a template for people who want to experiment with creating simple bots. I have created this project as a Proof Of Concept for [CoinStats](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@moonrise/coinstats-a-nodejs-cryptocurrency-statistic-bot-automatic-posting-to-steemblockchain), since I want to implement the same behaviour in it.

Also was CryptoCompare part of an interactive tutorials series of mine, which currently stopped. CryptoCompare has reached a version which is stable and note worthy to release. Do whatever you want with this template :)

#### Usage
- Copy config_default.json and rename it to config.json
- npm install (Node v7.5.0 needed)
- node index.js
- Copy output url to use it :)
